I threw together a simple Jekyll site that doesn't look terrible.

It should support syntax highlighting with `{% raw %}{% highlight %}{% endraw %}` tag:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
#Bash script

echo "I am a bash script"
exit 0
{% endhighlight %}

There is also support for fenced code blocks:
~~~bash
/bin/bash -c "echo 'foo'"
~~~

and Github Gist embedding:

{% gist yarektyshchenko/2a00beed20996aea5fd4 %}
